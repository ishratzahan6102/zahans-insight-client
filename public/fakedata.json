While sunbathing on a beach near Gaviota State Park during their 'Senior Ditch Day' in June 1963, the two were bound with rope and were shot eleven and nine times respectively. Their bodies were dragged to a nearby shack where Robert's father found them soon after. Similarly, in October 1966, Cheri Bates left her father a note to say she'd gone to the Riverside City College Library only for her Volkswagen Beetle to be found abandoned there the next day, and her stabbed corpse left between two nearby houses. The local paper received a typed confession from the supposed killer one month later, and the following year, the newspaper, police, and Bates' father all received similar handwritten letters signed 'Z'. These events wouldn't be linked to the Zodiac killer until years later.",

Jensen was found shot in the back inside the car, and Faraday was shot in the head outside the vehicle. In Vallejo the next year, Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau were attacked while parked in another lovers' lane. A stranger shot them both. Ferrin died, but Mageau survived.",

SFPD's Dave Toschi investigated the scene and would soon become the inspector most famously related to the case.",

He expressed frustration in July 1970 about the lack of people wearing these buttons. The Zodiac had claimed an unidentified fourteenth victim, or it might have been Avery himself, according to a Halloween card Avery received a year after receiving Paul Stine's bloody clothes in the mail.",

The actor wore dress pants with a big Prada logo buckle on it, and tucked his button-up gray jacket into them. In addition, he eschewed a traditional dress shirt in favor of a contemporary collarless look and unbuttoned his jacket to show off the top underneath. Another talking point were his shoes, which were heeled boots, a favorite of Chalamet and a classy substitute for a traditional oxford.",

Zendaya made a bold red carpet debut in Mexico City earlier this week for a young London-based designer; Florence Pugh dazzled in a futuristic Torishéju dress at the same event. Butler and Chalamet, on the other hand, have been donning chic, modern ensembles. Chalamet wore a gray collarless suit this week, and Butler wore a leather cowl-neck top from Hermès. Although there is a lot of action in the movie, we think the steps and repeats are even more exciting. We respond with, 'Keep 'em coming.'",
